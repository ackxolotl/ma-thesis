First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor,
Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Georg~Carle, for his enduring support and confidence in my
abilities, for the opportunity to conduct research at his chair, for our
discussions on my work, and for enabling me to participate in conferences and
workshops.

I would like to say a special thank you to Paul Emmerich for all the pleasurable
conversations, his moral support, and the invaluable feedback on my work. His
profound knowledge and enthusiasm for research made my time at the chair all the
more enjoyable.

I also wish to thank Florian Wiedner and Benedikt Jaeger for their guidance and
feedback, which contributed significantly to the success of this thesis.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Heiko Simoneit, Catharina Großmaß and Clemens
Horn for their friendship, unclouded optimism in all circumstances and our
leisure activities.

And last but not least, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my family
for their unconditional support throughout the last years.
